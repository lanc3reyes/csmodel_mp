    "## Dataset Description\n",
    "\n",
    "**Name:** IoT-Based Environmental Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "**Source:** [Kaggle - IoT-Based Environmental Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ziya07/iot-based-environmental-dataset?resource=download)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary:**  \n",
    "This dataset provides detailed environmental and mental health data collected from a university setting using IoT sensors. It includes environmental metrics such as temperature, humidity, air quality, noise, lighting, and crowd density, as well as student-reported mental health indicators like stress level, sleep hours, mood score, and mental health status. The goal is to analyze how environmental conditions may influence students' well-being.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Structure:**  \n",
    "- Each row represents a 15-minute interval of environmental readings (e.g., temperature, noise, air quality) from various campus locations.\n",
    "- The dataset contains 1000 rows and 12 columns.\n",
    "- The dataset contains the following columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Column Name   | Description                                      |\n",
    "|---------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n",
    "| timestamp\t| Time of data capture |\n",
    "| location_id | ID of the sensor/location |\n",
    "| temperature_celsius |\tAmbient temperature |\n",
    "| humidity_percent | Humidity level |\n",
    "| noise_level_db | Noise level in decibels |\n",
    "| lighting_lux | Lighting level |\n",
    "| crowd_density | Estimated number of people in the area |\n",
    "| stress_level | Self-reported stress level |\n",
    "| sleep_hours | Self-reported sleep duration |\n",
    "| mood_score | Mood score (likely on a scale, e.g., 0â€“3) |\n",
    "| mental_health_status | Binary indicator (0 = healthy, 1 = issues) |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Provenance:**  \n",
    "Compiled and published by Ziya on Kaggle. Last updated in 2025.\n",
    "\n",
    "**License:**  \n",
    "Check the Kaggle page for licensing details; the dataset is typically available for educational and non-commercial use.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:**  \n",
    "- The location_id column refers to the specific IoT sensor or monitored area within the university environment.\n",
    "- The dataset was likely compiled from various environmental sensors and self-reported student responses, then structured into a CSV file.\n",
    "- mental_health_status is a simplified binary label and may not capture the full complexity of a student's psychological condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Potential Implications and Biases:**\n",
    "- Since the data involves self-reported mental health metrics, responses may be subject to personal bias, underreporting, or overestimation.\n",
    "- Sensor accuracy and calibration may affect the consistency and precision of environmental measurements (e.g., noise or air quality).\n",
    "- The dataset is limited to a university population and may not generalize to broader demographic or institutional contexts.\n",
    "- Environmental conditions are highly dynamic, and snapshots in time may not fully capture long-term exposure or effects.\n",
