    "## Dataset Description\n",
    "\n",
    "**Name:** IoT-Based Environmental Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "**Source:** [Kaggle - IoT-Based Environmental Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ziya07/iot-based-environmental-dataset?resource=download)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary:**  \n",
    "This dataset provides detailed environmental and mental health data collected from a university setting using IoT sensors. It includes environmental metrics such as temperature, humidity, air quality, noise, lighting, and crowd density, as well as student-reported mental health indicators like stress level, sleep hours, mood score, and mental health status. The goal is to analyze how environmental conditions may influence students' well-being.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Structure:**  \n",
    "- Each row represents a 15-minute interval of environmental readings (e.g., temperature, noise, air quality) from various campus locations.\n",
    "- The dataset contains 1000 rows and 12 columns.\n",
    "- The dataset contains the following columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Column Name   | Description                                      |\n",
    "|---------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n",
    "| timestamp\t| Time of environmental reading data capture (format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS) |\n",
    "| location_id | Identifier where sensors are deployed (values range from 101-105) |\n",
    "| temperature_celsius |\tAmbient temperature in Celsius |\n",
    "| humidity_percent | Relative humidity percentage |\n",
    "| air_quality_index | Air quality measurement (higher values indicate poorer air quality) |\n",
    "| noise_level_db | Noise level in decibels |\n",
    "| lighting_lux | Illumination intensity in lux |\n",
    "| crowd_density | Number of people in the area |\n",
    "| stress_level | Modeled student stress score (0–100) |\n",
    "| sleep_hours | Estimated sleep duration in hours |\n",
    "| mood_score | Modeled emotional score ranging from -3 (very negative) to +3 (very positive) |\n",
    "| mental_health_status | Categorical indicator (0 = Normal, 1 = Mild Risk, 2 = At Risk) |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Provenance:**  \n",
    "Compiled and published by Ziya on Kaggle. Last updated in 2025.\n",
    "\n",
    "**License:**  \n",
    "Check the Kaggle page for licensing details; the dataset is typically available for educational and non-commercial use.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:**  \n",
    "- The location_id column refers to the specific IoT sensor or monitored area within the university environment.\n",
    "- The dataset was likely compiled from various environmental sensors and self-reported student responses, then structured into a CSV file.\n",
    "- mental_health_status is a simplified binary label and may not capture the full complexity of a student's psychological condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Potential Implications and Biases:**\n",
    "- Since the data involves self-reported mental health metrics, responses may be subject to personal bias, underreporting, or overestimation.\n",
    "- Sensor accuracy and calibration may affect the consistency and precision of environmental measurements (e.g., noise or air quality).\n",
    "- The dataset is limited to a university population and may not generalize to broader demographic or institutional contexts.\n",
    "- Environmental conditions are highly dynamic, and snapshots in time may not fully capture long-term exposure or effects.\n",

    "## Data Preprocessing\n",
    "Our data preprocessing approach ensures that the dataset is accurate, consistent, and fully prepared for analysis. We started by inspecting the data for missing values and duplicates, confirming that the dataset is complete and unique. Next, we standardized numerical precision across relevant columns, rounding values to appropriate decimal places to enhance consistency and interpretability. We also converted key columns—such as timestamps and categorical variables—to their correct data types, enabling more effective time-based and group analyses. Outlier detection was performed using summary statistics, allowing us to identify any unusual or potentially problematic values. Each transformation was carefully documented and verified, resulting in a clean and reliable dataset that provides a solid foundation for meaningful exploratory analysis and modeling."
